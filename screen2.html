      <h3 class="card-title">PASSION & Hobby</h3>
      <p class="card-text">
        <strong>Hobbys</strong> are to read and draw which i do quite
        nicely although my drawings are far form a pro but my skill of reading compensates for that, As per my
        <strong>PASSION</strong> is to code, my first introduction to this skill was by a senior who was working
        with python and trying to make a 2D game, I found it interesting and soon downloaded an ide to work with
        python the time i started i was having a <strong>HP laptop</strong> with a <strong>pentium
          processor</strong> with <strong>4GB</strong> RAM which after "hello world" took a hefty time to do
        the processing, believe me or not nothing can make a developer more angry than that, I didn't have money
        to buy a new one so i left learning pythonðŸ˜…, there was no choice other then learning another language
        ("to quit was never a choice") i asked a teacher and started learning c++, i learned about 65% of that
        and soon realized i was not into it so i open youtube and went like "best programming language to learn in
        2020" and usually there were tons of videos out there, after watching 3-4 videos I landed to a chanel named
        clever_programer thats where I was attracted towards javascript, every video told I should learn web development
        but none told me why, the videos on that chanel(clever_programer) were so glamorous I couldn't resist to click
        and view one, when they told the things i will be able to do with the skills I started with the basics of HTML
        followed by CSS and there was a big pause because i cant proceed to JS without learning CSS basics i struggled
        even to link the style sheet to HTML(I guess this is the biggest disadvantage of bing a self taught developer
        there is none to tell you what to do when you are stuck). I was giving 2 to 3 hour daily to programming and even
        after a month i was not able to position a element properly, there was a burnout, nearly every day I get
        frustrated an hour without an error was a relaxation to me but the real struggle was yet to come. By any means i
        was now into CSS basics and that was a way to go, so this time to avoid struggles I made up my mind to follow a
        good tutorial and stick to it until I have good results, and it didn't happen that way, everywhere everyone said
        learning JS was easy and it was easy till i reached to the loops where the hustle starts, I have literally cried
        over the code not working and thought i was wasting my time... If you have been reading till here i hope you
        found my story interesting, to read what happened next follow me on instagram because i am creating a blog soon
        enough so that i can share my story and other motivational stories with you, so stay tuned with me.
